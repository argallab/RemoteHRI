   	<p>Thanks for completing our study!</p>

   	<p>Our study was designed to examine how people reason about <b>[insert purpose of study here, and
         disclose information about deception or any special procedures, if they were used]</b>.</p>
	
   	<p>As you might have noticed, some of the problems in the study were easy and some were
         difficult. Our goal is to determine whether the difficult problems are those that require
         people to carry out more complex simulations.</p>

		<p>Thank you once again for your involvement in our study. Your data will be stored anonymously
         on a secure server and archived. You will be credited for your participation within the next
         72 hours. Please enter the phrase <b>[insert finalization phrase here]</b> into Amazon Mechanical
         Turk to confirm your participation.</p>
		
		<p>If you have any questions, feel free to email <b>[insert experimentor name here]</b>, at
